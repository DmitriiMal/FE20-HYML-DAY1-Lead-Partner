      <H1>ABOUT</H1>
      <p>From director Guy Ritchie (Rocknrolla, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) comes a fresh take on the classic
        master detective Sherlock Holmes starring Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law and Rachel McAdams. Renowned "consulting
        detective" Sherlock Holmes (Downey Jr.--Iron Man) has a reputation for solving the most complex mysteries. With
        the aid of his trusted ally Dr. John Watson (Law--The Aviator), Holmes is unequaled in his pursuit of criminals,
        relying on his singular powers of observation, his remarkable deductive skills -- and the blunt force of his
        fists. But now a threat unlike anything Holmes has ever confronted threatens London ... and it's just the
        challenge he's looking for.​</p>
